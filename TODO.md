### Exercise 4 (Go back through this after data analysis course and morningstar notes)
Answer the questions on the bottom of the exercise, 

#### Extension 2
Look at jknife vs binned vsbootstrapped errors as function of n_corr
Look into auto correlation

#### Extension 3
Look at the distribution of the individual binned/jacknifed/bootstrapped averages. They should be gaussians centered at the combined average with a width equal to the total error (probably a more correct word than total?). I will look into producing these using histograms and fitting gaussians to them. Understand why this is useful.

### Exercise 5 (Go back through after doing renormalisation)
Do it,

### Exercise 8
CBA

### Exercise 11

Test autocorrelation
