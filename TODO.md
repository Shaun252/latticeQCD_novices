### Exercise 4
Answer the questions on the bottom of the exercise


#### Extension 2
Look at jknife vs binned vsbootstrapped errors as function of n_corr
Look into auto correlation

#### Extension 3
Look at the distribution of the individual binned/jacknifed/bootstrapped averages. They should be gaussians centered at the combined average with a width equal to the total error (probably a more correct word than total?). I will look into producing these using histograms and fitting gaussians to them. Understand why this is useful.

### Exercise 5
Do it, Ask postdoc

### Exercise 7
Complete expansions, they are solved by iteratively subbing back in.
Solve for the improved action / action, remember boundary terms.
Compute jacobian
Redo exercise 6 with this improved action.
Understand what is actually happening here, ask postdoc

### Exercise 8
Do it

### Exercise 9
Work through the derivation on page 30 for the plaquette. Using this I need to construct the rectangular and twisted rectangular improved actions.

### Exercise 10
Do it, ask postdoc.

### Exercise 11

Higher number of su3 matrices ~200 as opposed to 50 seem to result in a higher value of plaquette energy.

Test autocorrelation

Understand how too low number of hits result in a high value for plaquette (link coming into equilibrium with surrounding?)

Understand how to minimise thermal steps

Understand error propagation with averaging over lattice then gauge.

#### Extension 1

Go through this, maybe add plaquette energy vs number of su(3) matrices

#### Exercise 12

Plot fit function at that value divided data at that value
Fold data
Chi^2 / dof and dof and p value
lsqfit tutorial

Maybe try fit the known functional form to data.

Get unsmeared improved working.
