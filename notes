Look at the S-eqn standard numerical solution and analytical for x^2 and x^4 potentials for values to compare.

Write some latex around the notebook with thoughts and information

Why does the bounds -6,6 mess things up so much?


Anytime algorithm isn't optimal = higher value of energy

High number of su3 matrices ~200 as opposed to 50 seem to result in a higher value of plaquette energy (check this again)

Test autocorrelation

Understand how too low number of hits result in a high value for plaquette (link coming into
equilibrium with surrounding?)

Understand how to minimise thermal steps

Understand error propagation with averaging over lattice then gauge.
